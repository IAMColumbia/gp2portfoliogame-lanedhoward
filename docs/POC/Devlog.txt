starting on the POC, i decided to lay out my plans for the
input reader system with a basic UML diagram.
i have written many notes and thought a lot about the architecture
over the last few weeks, so i organized those notes into a real uml diagram
(OriginalUML.png)

there are still problems i don't know how im going to solve. but i feel confident
in my plans for the bulk of this

i want the system to be button-agnostic. that is, i dont want to care how many
buttons there are in the game. 
whether it is { Light Punch, Light Kick, ... Heavy Kick}
or simply { A, B, C }
it would be nice to be able to read buttons into gestures. 
so you can have gestures that include directions and buttons. (ex: LP, MP, forward, LK, MK)
but i am willing to sacrifice button gestures for button agnosticism.

so im thinking maybe there can be an IButtons type that just gets passed along through the whole
system. 
the host puts IButtons (an array/list of the buttons pressed at that time) into the hostpackage
the inputreader holds these IButtons along with the hostpackage, and after it reads the gestures,
it simply puts the IButtons into the ReadPackage as well. without ever touching them

ReadablePackage:
i dont know how i will want to keep track of Time so i made it a float for now
i also think i will need to know if the character was facing right while this input was pressed
but maybe i won't need that actually

wrote the gestures and reading system!
jeff you'll be so proud of me, i wrote some unit tests to test it, since i didn't have anything
running inside monogame yet.

theres still some features i want to add to gestures, like having disallowed directions.

like for example. a DP input (Forward, Down, Down-forward) cannot inclue a back input in between

without this disallowed direction, it would be impossible to perform a quarter-circle-forward
(Down, Down-forward, Forward) immediately after walking, 
because it would trigger DP input since it has better priority
but you can do Walk forward -> press back -> quarter circle forward 
and that would read as a quarter circle forward, since the back input would disqualify it
from being a dp
